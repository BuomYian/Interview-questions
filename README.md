## Introduction

In technical interviews, proficiency with data structures and algorithms is essential. This repository contains a collection of examples, explanations, and challenges to help you ace your coding interviews.

## Big O Notation

A crucial concept for evaluating the performance of an algorithm. This section covers:

- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Common Big O classifications like O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n^2), etc.

## Data Structures

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient algorithms. This section covers various data structures with implementation in JavaScript:

- **Arrays**: Basics and common operations
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists
- **Stacks**: LIFO structure with common use cases
- **Queues**: FIFO structure and its applications
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value storage with optimal lookups
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and more
- **Graphs**: Representation and traversal (BFS, DFS)

## Algorithms

Algorithms are the heart of coding interviews. This section delves into a variety of algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, and their applications
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation, and solving complex problems
- **Recursion**: Tackling problems with recursive solutions
